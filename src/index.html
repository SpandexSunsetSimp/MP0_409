      <p>I’m a junior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign pursuing a degree in Computer Science, and I’m excited about building a career as a software engineer. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and learning new technologies that can make a real impact. Outside the classroom, I like to stay active through badminton and cycling, which help me balance my academic and personal life. I’m also an avid gamer, always looking for ways to engage with interactive worlds and sharpen my strategic thinking. In my downtime, I enjoy watching shows—some of my favorites include Brooklyn Nine-Nine for its humor, Breaking Bad for its gripping storytelling, and My Little Pony for its creativity and positivity. Altogether, I strive to combine my technical skills with my curiosity and diverse interests to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
